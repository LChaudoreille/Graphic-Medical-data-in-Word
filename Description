I wanted to create a Care sheet with the only tool I had : Word 2010.
This standalone doc can be used to draw on a one day basis :
- Body temperature
- Oxygen saturation
- Blood pressure
- Heart Rate
- Pain
- Medication given
- Volume of oxygen given
- Respiratory rate
To ease the reading, I added a scale per measure, dot marks and checkboxes to choose what to draw.
Contains all the code to represent in a Word's canvas :
- data lines,
- data columns,
- data floating columns,
- data points.
